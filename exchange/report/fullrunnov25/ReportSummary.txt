Note the following is reported from a GO-CAM perspective, not a Reactome one.  
Where Reactome may consider a complex appearing in multiple reactions as one entity, GO-CAM considers each instance separately. 
 As a result number for classifications (especially complexes) may be larger here then they would be were this reported from a Reactome perspective. 
Without considering reasoning for instance classification - just looking at direct Reactome assertions...

For unclassified instances, reasoner can add 8838 non-trivial (not BFO, non-root GO) classifications for:
	170	new bp
	4158	new mf
	0	new cc
	4510	new complex

For classified instances, reasoner can add 1587 non-trivial (not BFO, non-root GO) deeper classifications for:
	755	deepened bp
	832	deepened mf
	0	deepened cc
	0	deepened complex
